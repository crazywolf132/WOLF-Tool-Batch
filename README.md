Well, there is what you could do with half of the program. The other half is just cool stuff. eg. Password Generator to make it easy to come up 
with passwords for databases and other stuff. There is even a Tool to clean your computer and defragment it.
I made life easy for you all and created 2 file destroyers. 1) Deletes all the corrupt files that will be made by this program if it crashes. 2) Uninstalls
it and all its crap from any device it is on.

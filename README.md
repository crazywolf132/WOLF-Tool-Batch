WHAT DOES THIS TOOL DO TO HELP ME?
Want to find any .psr / .ufo / bank psr / InvoiceTop / InvoiceBottom / ReportLogo files on a clients server, or your own?
Well, there is what you could do with half of the program. The other half is just cool stuff. eg. Password Generator to make it easy to come up 
with passwords for databases and other stuff. There is even a Tool to clean your computer and defragment it.
I made life easy for you all and created 2 file destroyers. 1) Deletes all the corrupt files that will be made by this program if it crashes. 2) Uninstalls
it and all its crap from any device it is on.
 
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Well, it works though some code in Batch Script... and a bit of luck and MAGIC!
 
WHAT IF I WANT TO ADD MORE FEATURES?
Well, you can... but you must stick to the license listed down below with all of its terms.
 
WHAT IS THAT WOLF PICTURE THAT SHOWS UP?
That WOLF is branding and it is under the License agreement you agree to when you open this program.
If that WOLF is removed or changed in anyway... It is counted as tampering with Owner ship, and makes you eligable to being sewed under Federal Law, which I am sure you do not want. So please leave the wold alone.
 
WHERE IS THE SOURCE CODE TO THIS PROJECT? 
The code for this Batch file is on github.com
